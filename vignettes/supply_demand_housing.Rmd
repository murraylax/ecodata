In this vignette, we will look at new housing construction costs, new housing sales prices, and the quantity of new house sales in the United States from 2021-2022, and use supply and demand reasoning to explain what happened in the U.S. housing market.

# Prompts

  1. Download data from FRED on median sales price for new houses in the United States for 2021-2022. 

  2. Download data from FRED on the number of sales for all new houses in the United States for 2021-2022 (hint: FRED describes this as "New Houses Sold by Sales Price in the United States, Total").

  3. Download data from FRED on construction costs for residential houses for 2021-2022 (hint: FRED describes this as "Producer Price Index by Commodity: Inputs to Residential Construction: New Housing Units Under Construction").

  4. Create time series plots for each of the three variables above.

  5. Describe the behavior of each variable over 2021-2022.

  6. Use the supply and demand model for new housing to explain what happened.


# Download Data

The following are the variables for median sales price, number of sales, and construction cost index:

  - Median sales price: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPNHSUS" target="_blank">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPNHSUS</a>
  
  - Number of sales: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NHSUSSPT" target="_blank">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NHSUSSPT</a>
  
  - Construction cost index: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPUIP2311001" target="_blank">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPUIP2311001</a>
  
Load the *tidyverse* and *ecodata* libraries and download the data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ecodata)

# Identify the data
data_sources <- c(
  "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPNHSUS",
  "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NHSUSSPT",
  "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPUIP2311001"
)
variable_names <- c("Median Sales Price", "Number of Sales", "Construction Cost Index")

# Download the data
housingdata <- get_ecodata(data_sources, variable_names)

# View the data
glimpse(housingdata)
ecodata_description_table(housingdata)
```

# Plot the data 

We will plot the data only for the range 2021-2022. Since each variable is measured on a different scale (prices are in dollars, number of sales is in units, and the construction cost index is an index), we will plot each variable on a separate graph.

```{r}
# Housing Prices
housingdata |>
  filter(Date >= "2021-01-01", Date <= "2022-12-31") |>
  ggplot_ecodata_ts(variables = "Median Sales Price", title = "Median Sales Price of New Houses in the U.S.", ylab = "") 
```
```{r}
# Quantity of Sales
housingdata |>
  filter(Date >= "2021-01-01", Date <= "2022-12-31") |>
  ggplot_ecodata_ts(variables = "Number of Sales", title = "Number of New Houses Sold in the U.S.")
```

```{r}
# Construction Costs
housingdata |>
  filter(Date >= "2021-01-01", Date <= "2022-12-31") |>
  ggplot_ecodata_ts(variables = "Construction Cost Index", title = "Construction Costs for New Houses in the U.S.")
```

# Observations

Construction costs increased from January 2021 until about July 2022. Over the two-year period 2021-2022, housing prices increased, but the quantity of new houses sold decreases. 

# Supply and Demand Analysis

An increase in construction costs increases the cost of producing new houses, which should lead to a decrease in supply. Below, we use a supply and demand model for new houses and shift the supply to the left.

The leftward shift in supply leads to a higher equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity. This is consistent with the U.S. housing market data from 2021-2022.
