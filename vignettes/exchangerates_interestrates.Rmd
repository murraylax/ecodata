In this vignette, we will look at new housing construction costs, new housing sales prices, and the quantity of new house sales in the United States from 2021-2022, and use supply and demand reasoning to explain what happened in the U.S. housing market.

# Prompts

  1. Download data from FRED on median sales price for new houses in the United States for 2021-2022. 

  2. Download data from FRED on the number of sales for all new houses in the United States for 2021-2022 (hint: FRED describes this as "New Houses Sold by Sales Price in the United States, Total").

  3. Download data from FRED on construction costs for residential houses for 2021-2022 (hint: FRED describes this as "Producer Price Index by Commodity: Inputs to Residential Construction: New Housing Units Under Construction").

  4. Create time series plots for each of the three variables above.

  5. Describe the behavior of each variable over 2021-2022.

  6. Use the supply and demand model for new housing to explain what happened.


# Download Data

The following are the variables for median sales price, number of sales, and construction cost index:

  - Median sales price: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPNHSUS" target="_blank">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPNHSUS</a>
  
  - Number of sales: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NHSUSSPT" target="_blank">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NHSUSSPT</a>
  
  - Construction cost index: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPUIP2311001" target="_blank">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPUIP2311001</a>
  
Load the *tidyverse* and *ecodata* libraries and download the data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ecodata)

# Identify the data
data_sources <- c(
  "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IR3TIB01USM156N",
  "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IR3TIB01GBM156N",
  "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXUSUK"
)
variable_names <- c("Interest Rate United States", "Interest Rate United Kingdom", "USD / GBP Exchange Rate")

# Download the data
mydata <- get_ecodata(data_sources, variable_names)

# Filter only for 2022
mydata <- mydata |>
  filter(Date >= "2022-01-01", Date <= "2022-12-31")

# View the data
glimpse(mydata)
ecodata_description_table(mydata)
```

# Plot the data 

## Interest Rates

Below we plot the two interest rates on the same graph.

```{r}
# Plot the interest rates
ggplot_ecodata_ts(mydata, 
                  variables = c("Interest Rate United States", "Interest Rate United Kingdom"),
                  title = "Interest Rates in the U.S. and U.K.")
```

We can see that interest rates rose in both countries in 2022, but the increase in the was higher in the United States than the United Kingdom.

## Exchange Rate



# Observations

Construction costs increased from January 2021 until about July 2022. Over the two-year period 2021-2022, housing prices increased, but the quantity of new houses sold decreases. 

# Supply and Demand Analysis

An increase in construction costs increases the cost of producing new houses, which should lead to a decrease in supply. Below, we use a supply and demand model for new houses and shift the supply to the left.

The leftward shift in supply leads to a higher equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity. This is consistent with the U.S. housing market data from 2021-2022.
